Sketch to App Store
======================

**Generate App Store images for all iPhone sizes from Sketch**

*Because the file structure was changed with the update, Sketch 3.1 is required.*

With the new iPhones, it's now a huge pain to create screenshots for iTunes Connect. This tool was created to save you a ton of time.

# How it works

Whenever you’re ready, do a File → Export.

# What the exports look like
This will generate 10 screenshots for each size, a set of images with the device and text, and a set that’s just the screenshot.

# How files are organized
Just choose a folder and the files will be exported like this. They are exported in *JPG* format because iTunes connect currently requires that.
